# Deprecation notice

I'm moving away from GitHub. You will find this [repository](https://git.c-r-t.tk/crt0mega/laa_patcher) at my [Gitea](https://git.c-r-t.tk/crt0mega).
## Usage:
`./laa_patcher win32pe.exe`
## What does it do?
It's a simple C progam which patches existing Win32 PE binaries to be LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE.
## Why does it look so ugly?
It's my first C program so don't judge.
